# retweets-away
Created to delete RT-tweets from a csv twitter archive.

Now you can also filter by date or words.

### main.py 
To read the **archive** twitter csv file.

Archive request in twitter webpage:

```Settings -> Account -> Content```

I chose the .csv file because the .js option is splitted across several files.

With just one file is more easy, this is not a big project.

### main_js.py
Nothing at this moment.

Will be useful for the new "Your twitter data" that gives tweets only in one .js file

Your data request in twitter webpage:

```Settings ->Y our Twitter data -> Download your Twitter data```
